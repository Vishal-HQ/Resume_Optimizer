# TODO: Add Match Score Feature to Resume Optimizer

- [x] Add `calculate_match_score` function to app.py to compute match percentage based on job keywords and matching keywords.
- [x] Integrate match score calculation into the "Optimize Resume" button logic after keyword extraction for both rule-based and OpenAI methods.
- [x] Update the Streamlit UI to display the match score as a metric after the keywords section.
- [x] Test the app to ensure the feature works correctly and no errors occur.
